This game was made for Global Game Jam 2025 with the theme "Bubbles".

# Game Objective
**How to Play**
- **Shoot Bubbles**:
  - Move the bow (← / →) and shoot (Spacebar) to collect points. Earn points equal to the item's price.
  - Each round lasts 2 minutes.
  - Popping two bubbles of a kind increases bubbles of that kind's value, increasing the amount of points they grant, but also their cost
- Market Strategy:
  - After each round, use your points to buy items. 
  - Prices rise as demand increases—plan carefully!

**Win or Lose**
- Win: Own all items in the market.
- Lose: Run out of points to buy items.
